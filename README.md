# Refactored Book List Application

# Description

This commit refactors the existing Book Connect list application to improve code readability, maintainability, and functionality. The code has been organized into classes and methods to enhance modularity and ease of understanding.

# Changes Made

## Class Definitions:

Book class: Represents a book object with properties like id, title, author, image, and genres.
BookList class: Manages the book list, pagination, UI rendering, event handling, filtering, and theme settings.

# Methods Refactored:

render(): Renders the list of books on the UI based on pagination.
addEventListeners(): Adds event listeners for buttons, search form, settings form, and list items.
populateGenreList(): Populates the genre dropdown list.
populateAuthorList(): Populates the author dropdown list.
setTheme(): Sets the theme based on user preference or system settings.
updateButtonLabel(): Updates the label of the 'Show more' button based on remaining books.

# Abstraction Benefits

Abstraction in the refactored Book List Application has made the code more maintainable and extendable by encapsulating the functionality into separate classes and methods. This approach allows for better organization of code, easier debugging, and the ability to make changes or add new features without affecting other parts of the application.

For example, the Book class encapsulates the properties and behavior of a book object, making it easier to manage book-related data. The BookList class handles the management of the book list, pagination, UI rendering, event handling, filtering, and theme settings, providing a clear separation of concerns.

By abstracting these functionalities into classes and methods, the code becomes more modular, reusable, and easier to understand. This modular structure also enables easier testing and maintenance of the application in the future. Additionally, the use of methods like render, addEventListeners, populateGenreList, populateAuthorList, setTheme, and updateButtonLabel further enhances the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

Overall, abstraction in the refactored Book List Application promotes code reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance, making it a more robust and flexible solution for managing and displaying a list of books.

# Functionality Added:

Search functionality: Allows users to search for books by title, author, and genre.
Theme settings: Users can switch between day and night themes.
Detailed book view: Clicking on a book displays its details in a modal.

# Additional Notes
The code structure follows best practices for object-oriented design and separation of concerns.
Event listeners are efficiently managed to handle user interactions and update the UI accordingly.
The application provides a seamless user experience with improved filtering and theme customization options.
